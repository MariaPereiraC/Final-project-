## Background
[Ever since I was a teenager I have faced anxiety and depression and I consider mental health is a topic that is unfortunately becoming more relevant day by day. This data analysis gives optimistic insights though: many of the hypotheses of people having severe anxiety, depression and stress were rejected.]
